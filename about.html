      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Abhinav Kumar Maurya</strong>, a passionate and technically driven IT undergraduate at Rajkiya
        Engineering College Mirzapur. I specialize in web development and software engineering, and I've gained
        practical experience in dynamic web apps, content architecture, and team-based tech projects. From CRM
        operations to teaching in rural areas, I believe in using technology to make meaningful impact. Iâ€™m also an
        active participant in coding events and tech fests, always exploring innovative solutions and real-world
        challenges.
